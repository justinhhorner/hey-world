I've posted a bit about my musical inspiration from the 90s over on Twitter/X. I decided to collect those posts and put them here in one post. So here you have it; some thoughts on a few artists from the 90s that have, and continue to, inspired me musically.

Growing up in the 90s was a good time. I miss the music of those days. I often search for live footage just like this one to relive it. I'm grateful we have a resource like YouTube to get that feeling back. We shouldn't take these things for granted.

Here's Jewel performing Who Will Save Your Soul at Woodstock 99.

I've been enjoying Hanson's music since watching MMMBop on VH1's Pop Up video in the 90s. I was reminded of them yesterday and now we're so back. Well written, well produced, just all around great.

Here's Hanson's Thinking Of You.

Reflecting more on artists that influenced me musically since the 90s. From Jewel to Alanis Morissette, vocalists seemed to be more distinctive and authentic then. 

The difference I perceive between then and now I suppose is a sense of freedom the artists had then that allowed them to embrace what makes them unique.

Here's Alanis Morisette performing You Learn at Woodstock 99.

Talking about 90s music influences again. I can't leave the topic without mentioning the The Goo Goo Dolls. So much of my younger years were spent listening to all the tracks from Dizzy Up The Girl and A Boy Named Goo. They helped me through some difficult times.

It's amazing how music can transport us back like a time machine. As soon as Name or Slide hits, I'm around friends and family that I've since lost. I used to wonder why people seem to get stuck in the past, and now a few more years wiser, I understand. 

Here's Goo Goo Dolls performing Name on Letterman in 95.
